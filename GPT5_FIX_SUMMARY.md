# GPT-5 Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Function Calling Now Enabled for GPT-5**
- **Previous Issue**: GPT-5 was forced to use JSON mode only (line 69-71 in openai_provider.py)
- **Fix**: Removed the forced JSON mode restriction, allowing GPT-5 to use function calling
- **Result**: GPT-5 can now attempt function calling first, with JSON mode as automatic fallback

### 2. **Temperature Parameter Handling**
- **Previous Issue**: GPT-5 had hardcoded `temperature=1.0` which could cause parameter conflicts
- **Fix**: Removed explicit temperature setting for GPT-5, letting the API use its default
- **Result**: No more parameter errors related to temperature

### 3. **Enhanced Empty Response Handling**
- **Previous Issue**: GPT-5 often returned empty responses with no recovery mechanism
- **Fix**: Added GPT-5-specific retry logic with enhanced prompting when empty responses occur
- **Result**: Better recovery from empty responses with automatic retries

### 4. **Improved Response Format Handling**
- **Previous Issue**: GPT-5 had issues with `response_format: json_object`
- **Fix**: GPT-5 now tries without response_format first in JSON mode
- **Result**: More reliable JSON responses from GPT-5

### 5. **Added Delays for GPT-5 Retries**
- **Previous Issue**: Immediate retries could fail due to API timing
- **Fix**: Added 2-3 second delays before retrying GPT-5 calls
- **Result**: Better success rate on retries

## Test Results

All tests now pass successfully:
- ✅ GPT-5 with function calling: PASSED (5 records extracted)
- ✅ GPT-5 with JSON mode: PASSED (2 records extracted)
- ✅ GPT-4o baseline: PASSED (2 records extracted)

## Key Differences: GPT-5 vs GPT-4o

| Feature | GPT-4o | GPT-5 |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Function Calling | Stable | Now working (was disabled) |
| Max Tokens Parameter | `max_tokens` | `max_completion_tokens` |
| Temperature Support | Custom values | Default only (parameter omitted) |
| Reasoning Effort | N/A | `medium` (configurable) |
| Timeout | 30 seconds | 10 minutes |
| Response Format | Reliable | May need fallback to text mode |
| API Response Time | Fast | Can be slower |

## Recommendations

1. **GPT-5 is now usable** but may still be slower than GPT-4o
2. **Function calling works** but has automatic fallbacks for reliability
3. **Keep retry settings** at 2+ attempts with 5+ second delays
4. **Monitor usage** as GPT-5 may use more tokens than GPT-4o

## Configuration

Your current config uses GPT-5:
```yaml
parser:
  provider: "openai"
  model: "gpt-5"
```

To switch to GPT-4o if needed:
```yaml
parser:
  provider: "openai"
  model: "gpt-4o"
```

Both models now work reliably with the improved error handling.
